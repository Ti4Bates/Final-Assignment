# DATASET BACKGROUND
This dataset contains entries from a collection of more than 
8000 Bronze Age British axeheads. It was created with the goal 
of combining many datasets containing axeheads for future research. 
Our shortened dataset provides the region of origin and various measurements. 
The data has been cleaned to exclude all entries where values are unknown, 
resulting in a sample size of 2250
